* Installation

Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] according to the instructions.  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]] is the Emacs's inbuilt
DIRectory EDitor, which doesn't require you to install it separably.  Please
make sure to install Emacs with major version 28+ (29 are recommended).

#+begin_src bash
  # Clone the repo
  git clone https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish ~/dirvish
  # Prepare the Emacs config
  cp ~/dirvish/docs/.emacs.d.example ~/.emacs.d
  # Start Emacs daemon (wait for the package installation)
  emacs --daemon
  # Open Emacs
  emacsclient -cn
#+end_src

Now you can =M-x dirvish RET=, enjoy!
